Tensorflow implementation of Recursive Neural Networks using LSTM units as
described in "Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning.

Forked from https://github.com/sapruash/RecursiveNN

- Run ./fetch_and_preprocess.sh to download and preprocess data.
- Run tf_sentimentmain.py to train the model on the SST dataset
